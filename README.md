# :books: The Book Is Right :books:

The Book Is Right is a serverless implementation of a web scraper for book prices, based on Python 3.

### Why?

Everyone loves to get the best bang for their buck. And books are no exception, whether it is for college or just for personal pleasure!

This started as a personal project to get my college books for the best price possible, as they get quite expensive. 
It was built from the beginning to run in a serverless cloud environment.

## Requirements
* An AWS account
    * AWS Access Key ID
    * AWS Secret Access Key
    * Preferred region to deploy
* SMTP server to send e-mails (I've used AWS SES, but any Gmail or Outlook account is fine)
* Python 3.6+ installed

## Installation
To install "The Book Is Right" you just have to run the following commands:

1. Create a virtual environment (venv) inside the root folder of the project.
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```
2. Source the newly created virtual environment.
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3. Install all the "pip" packages from `requirements.txt`.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Fill out the variables inside the `settings.py` file.
5. Run the CLI app to auto-deploy it to AWS.
    ```bash
    python thebookisright.py deploy
    ```
6. Done!
